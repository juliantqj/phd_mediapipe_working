# skeleton_mediapipe

There are two types of MediaPipe skeleton tracking in this folder:- pose and holistic.

Pose: https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/pose_landmarker
Holistic: https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/holistic_landmarker

Use the "clean" version, the other version are just for backup. "edit" version is to play around with whatever.

You have to first create a folder called "videos" for the code to reference the location of input source.
After running the code, "export_dat" and "export_vid" will be automatically created (if you don't already have it).
Then subsequent analysis will export the data into those two folders.
